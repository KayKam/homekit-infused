## Addons
Addons are baked-in preconfigured cards that you can turn on/off on any view. You can add an addon by adding the key to your view configuration (which is done in /hki-user/config/views.yaml). ALL addons are preconfigured with a vertical-stack and a title, you MUST keep this in mind when defining addons. Each addon has some extra options for the stack, so the first section of each addons documentation shows you those extra options.

You can control the placement of the addons by using the [layout](addons/layout.md) addon and/or by changing the order of defining your addons. The addons that are defined first will be rendered first. How to exactly configure an addon depends on the addon and you should read the addons specific documentation before adding them to your configuration.

```yaml
# views.yaml (example how to add addons)
  my_view:
    subtitle: Overview
    icon: mdi:thermostat
    addons:
      thermostat:
        - title: My thermostats
          entities:
            - # Thermostat addon config here!

  my_second_view:
    subtitle: Overview
    icon: mdi:vacuum-cleaner
    addons:
      button:
        - title: My lights
          entities:
            - # Button addon config here!
```

### Advanced

Addons can be defined multiple times, this is particularly useful when you want for example a view with a button stack at the top, a map in the middle and another button stack at the bottom.

To define an extra addon of the same type in a single view you MUST add a suffix to the addon name, it doesn't matter what the name of the suffix is, as long as you use one. `addon_whatever:`

```yaml
# views.yaml (example of defining multiple addons of the same type)
  my_view:
    title: Location
    addons:
      button:
        - title: My Quicktoggles
          entities:
            - switch.phone
      button_2:
        - title: My second quicktoggles
          entities:
            - switch.iphone
      button_whatever:
        - title: Another button addon
          entities:
            - switch.galaxy
```

Addons can also be conditional depending on a state of an entity!

```yaml
# views.yaml (example of defining multiple addons of the same type)
  my_view:
    title: Location
    addons:
      button:
        - title: This will only show when Jimmy is home
          conditional: true
          conditions:
            - entity: person.jimmy
              state: "home"
          entities:
            - switch.phone
      button_2:
        - title: This will only show when Jimmy AND Stephanie are home
          conditional: true
          conditions:
            - entity: person.jimmy
              state: "home"
            - entity: person.stephanie
              state: "home"
          entities:
            - switch.iphone
      button_3:
        - title: This will only show when Jimmy is NOT home AND Stephanie IS home
          conditional: true
          conditions:
            - entity: person.jimmy
              state_not: "home"
            - entity: person.stephanie
              state: "home"
          entities:
            - switch.iphone
```

### Extra Information

What happened to the `simple_weather`, `devices`, `rooms`, `sun_card`, `find_my`, `layout`, `columns`, `mini-media-player`, `search` `vacuum` and `graph` addons that were present in HKI 4?

Well the reasoning can be found below:
- `sun_card`, `mini-media-player` and `graph` were addons that are either too large to template or unnecessary to add, you can still use them with the `custom:` addon, this allows for all their options to be unlocked and gives much much more customization.
- `find_my` and `layout` have NOT been removed but had its documentation moved to the configuration page instead.
- `columns` is redundant and rather confusing. Columns are now just set per addon instead.
- `devices` has been merged into the new `button:` addon.
- `rooms` has been reworked and is now called `areas:`.
- `simple_weather` has been merged with the `weather:` addon and can be found there.
- `search` is now integrated into the profile menu.
- `vacuum` is just too hard to template whilst there are so many great options already available. I suggest using the custom addon with a nice vacuum card (like Xiaomi Vacuum Card or Xiaomi Vacuum Map Card)
