**NOTE:** this addon is just a preconfigured [custom:button-card](https://github.com/custom-cards/button-card) template. You can use 99,9% of the options that are available in that card, HKI however has some extra options/configuration that can not be found in that card.

You can use any of the following options to modify your addon.

### Stack Config

| Name | Required | Default | Description |
|----------------------------------|-------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| title | no | undefined | Set the title of the stack, ommitting this line will or setting `title: hide` will hide the title |
| columns | no | 3 | Define the number of columns this stack will use |
| square | no | true | Set if the buttons should be square or not, this is only useful when you set individual aspect_ratios in the config below |
| lock | no | false | this locks the entire stack and will now need two taps to turn on/off, the first tap unlocks, the second toggles |
| aspect_ratio | no | 1/1 | Set the aspect ratio of all the buttons in this stack at once |
| [view_layout](layout.md#view-layout) | no | undefined | This is best used in conjunction with the [layout](layout.md#view-layout) addon, but can also be used to control whether to show this stack on different screen sizes. |
| conditional | no | false | Setting this to `true` will make the stack condtional |
| conditions | no | undefined | Add entities and conditions, this will determine when this addon will be shown, e.g. if entity x is turned `on`, then show this addon (see [addons](../addons.md) for examples |
| entities | yes | list of entities | List all your entities you want to show up here |

### Button Options

By default you must enter an array of entities like in the examples below, this does not need extra options and will just get the global name/icon.
You must define it as an object instead to make use of the options below.

| Name | Required | Default | Description |
|----------------------------------|-------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| entity | yes | undefined | Set the entity used |
| type | no | auto | This forces a button to be seen by HKI as a specific type, which alters the appearance. Choose between `rgb`, `color-temp`, `switch`, `graph`, `sensor`, `cover`, `scene`, `thermostat` or `fan`. By default HKI tries to figure out itself what kind of type the button is, but if it gets it wrong force it by setting the type |
| name | no | global_name | Set a name for this button, this accepts [JS templates](https://github.com/custom-cards/button-card#javascript-templates) |
| label | no | none | Set a label for this button, this accepts [JS templates](https://github.com/custom-cards/button-card#javascript-templates) |

| background_image | no | undefined | Set an URL or a `/local/*` to an image to show as background |
| lock | no | false | this locks this button and will now need two taps to turn on/off, the first tap unlocks, the second toggles |
| aspect_ratio | no | 1/1 | Set a custom aspect_ratio for this button, note that you will want to set `square: false` in the stacks configuration when setting anything other than 1/1 |
| size | no | 25% | Set the icon size, note that this setting is not always working as expected due to the grid used, play around with it |

#### HKI Specific Button Types Extra Options

Some buttons get some extra options if you set `type: graph`, `type: switch`, `type: rgb`, `type: color-temp`, `type: thermostat` and `type: cover`.

| Name | Required | Default | Description |
|----------------------------------|-------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| popup_style | no | auto | When having `type: switch`, `type: rgb` or `type: color-temp`, you can force the popup to be either `switch` or a `slider` |
||||
| line_color | no | red | When having `type: graph` you can set the line_color, this can be a css name or a hex value (e.g. Red or '#FF22FF') |
| graph_type | no | line | When having `type: graph` you can change the graph_type between `bar` or `line` |
||||
| cover_control | no | cover_position | When having `type: cover` you can set if you want to control the `cover_position` or `tilt_position` with the slider |  
||||
| action | no | undefined | When having `type: thermostat`, you can reverse the default tap/hold action behaviour by setting `action: alternative` |
| ambient_temperature | no | undefined | When having `type: thermostat`, set this to show the current temperature from a different sensor in your thermostat buttons, this is only an aesthetic change and doesn't change the functionality of your thermostat! |
| attribute | no | undefined | Only works when having `type: thermostat`! If your thermostats show `undefined` as its state you should use the following config `attribute: state` |

#### Tips
By default the label is either the brightness of a light or empty, however with button-card JS templates you can have a cool label like this

![Homekit Infused](../images/hki-button-3.png)

```yaml
# views.yaml (example with custom label)
  my_view:
    addons:
      button:
        - title: Laundry Room
          entities:
            - entity: switch.washing_machine
              lock: true
              label: "[[[ return `${states['sensor.washing_machine_power'].state} W`; ]]]"
```

The same is true for icons and you can template an icon to be different for each state:

```yaml
# views.yaml (example with custom icon)
  my_view:
    addons:
      button:
        - title: Laundry Room
          entities:
            - entity: switch.washing_machine
              icon: "[[[ if (entity.state == 'on') return `mdi:lamp`; else return `mdi:floor-lamp` ]]]"
```
