## Logo

Instead of a title and subtitle in the header you can also opt to use a logo instead, there are a few options you can set when using a logo.
Unfortunately images come in hundreds of different sizes and shapes. You can adjust the way the logo is placed with the options below.
You will probably have to restart a lot to get this right, sorry!

I will always advise you to use an image with a transparent background!

| Name | Required | Default | Description |
|----------------------------------|-------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| image | yes | local/images/logos/my_logo.png | Set the url to your image, this can be an external source as well. The default example shows how to use a local path |
| width | yes | 200px | Set the width of this logo, you MUST adjust this to your own likings |
| height | yes | 60px | Set the height of this logo, you MUST adjust this to your own likings, however you should not exceed `81px`, which is the headers max height. For best results you probably shouldn't go over `60px` |
| margin_top | no | 0px | You can align the logo more to the top or bottom by using a value like `-15px` or `15px`, you should play around with this to get it right |
| margin_left | no | 0px | You can align the logo more to the left or right by using a value like `-15px` or `15px`, you should play around with this to get it right |
